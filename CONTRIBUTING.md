## Coding Guidelines

### Swift Style Guide

We follow the [Ray Wenderlich Swift Style Guide](https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-style-guide) with these key points:

* **Naming**: Use descriptive names with camel case for functions, variables, and constants
* **Spacing**: Use 4 spaces for indentation (Xcode default)
* **Comments**: Write self-documenting code, add comments only when necessary
* **SwiftUI**: Follow SwiftUI best practices and conventions
* **Force Unwrapping**: Avoid force unwrapping, use guard or if-let instead

### Git Commit Messages

```

**Types:** feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, build, ci, chore, revert

See [COMMIT_CONVENTION.md](COMMIT_CONVENTION.md) for full details.

### Code Organization

* Keep related functionality in the same file
* Separate UI components into their own views
* Use extensions to organize code logically
* Follow MVVM pattern where appropriate

## Testing

* Write unit tests for new functionality
* Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
* Test on both light and dark mode
* Test window resizing behavior

## Documentation

* Update README.md if you change functionality
* Add inline documentation for complex functions
* Update CHANGELOG.md with your changes

## Adding New Tools

When adding a new developer tool:

1. Create a new View in `ContentView.swift` or a separate file
2. Add the tool to the tab selector
3. Implement the core functionality
4. Add keyboard shortcuts where appropriate
5. Include paste/copy functionality
6. Add appropriate error handling
7. Test thoroughly
8. Update README with the new feature
